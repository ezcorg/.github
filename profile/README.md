# `👋 hello!`

## Where am I?

You've found the GitHub organization belonging to [`ez co`](https://joinez.co), a democratic collective of technologists.

## What's a "_democratic collective_"?

A “democratic collective” generally refers to a group, organization, or community that is owned, governed, and operated by its members, with decisions made through democratic processes rather than by a single leader or hierarchical authority.

## How does that work?

At `ez co`, any decision can be turned into a vote (by anyone). Everyone is obligated to participate in each vote, unless they've delegated their vote to another entity. 

This is the only initial rule, but of course you can vote to add more and modify the system.

## Why would anyone want that?

You want a fair and transparent organization which prioritizes the will of the whole over the wants of a few. You might not buy into the idea that power should be held and allocated by the most self-serving and politically motivated people within an organization.

While entrepreneurial, you probably also identify strongly as a democratic socialist.
